### EnergyMeasurement 

## Introduction
A basic implementation of energy consumption, storage and production measurement of an apartment. An apartment and five flats are simulated using SNMP4J library. The model objects are created for this business domain and each model object has a responsibility to handle a set of managed object. 

# Agent
The Agent is bind to given host and port and is responsible to create these model object which in turn creates and register managed objects. 

# Manager
A Manager which is used to set and get values of managed object is also provided. The manager is not bind to specific port however it can be used along with other first citizen classes such as PrintStateOfManagedObject and SimulateSummarScenario.

# Traps
A simple trap which record changes in energy generated by solar is provided. The sender is part of manager and receiver is part of Agent. Receiver runs on same machine where Agent is running however on different port.

At a minimal level, as of now (March 4, 2017) only energy produce by solar source trap is provided. The sender runs along with manager whereas receiver runs with Agent on 2002 port.
 
# How to run 

**To start agent**
>java edu.tcd.nds.nwmgmt.snmp.EnergyMeasurementAgent localhost/2001

**To print default values of managed objects**
>java edu.tcd.nds.nwmgmt.snmp.PrintStateOfManagedObject 127.0.0.1/2001

**To simulate summer scenario** where energy generation by solar is increased from default 20 to 40
>java edu.tcd.nds.nwmgmt.snmp.SimulateSummarScenario 127.0.0.1/2001

**To check the updated values** of other source of energy provider such as hydro and storage
>java edu.tcd.nds.nwmgmt.snmp.PrintStateOfManagedObject 127.0.0.1/2001
